# Description

This repository contains my own Arch Linux repository that includes a selection of third party PKGBUILDS and my own ones.

There are several reasons that I'd include third party on this repository:

- Fix issues that haven't been fixed in the AUR time after it was reported.
- Own customizations that cannot be included in the AUR.
- Saving build time

From my own PKGBUILDS, some of them are published in AUR, but some others don't because are designed by my own use cases
