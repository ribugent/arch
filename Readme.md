# Description

This repository contains my own Arch Linux repository that includes a selection of third party PKGBUILDS.

There are several reasons that I'd include them on this repository:

- Fix issues that haven't been fixed in the AUR time after it was reported.
- Own customizations that cannot be included in the AUR.
- Saving build time
